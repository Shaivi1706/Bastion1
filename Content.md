# 🔍 PROBLEM SECTION

## Heading:

> Modern Data Stacks Move Fast. Trust Breaks Faster.

### Body Copy:

Today’s data platforms suffer from:

* ❌ Outdated documentation
* ❌ Silent schema drift
* ❌ Broken dashboards due to unnoticed changes
* ❌ No deterministic control over AI-generated metadata
* ❌ Governance tools that detect issues too late

Traditional catalogs focus on discovery.
Observability tools focus on anomalies.

**Nobody enforces schema integrity at the control-plane level.**

# 🛡 WHAT BASTION DOES

## Heading:

> Bastion Is Your Schema Integrity Layer

### Description:

Bastion connects to your Archestra agents and introduces a deterministic governance layer between AI agents and your production database.

It continuously:

* Extracts schema metadata
* Generates semantic definitions
* Compares snapshots over time
* Detects breaking changes
* Computes column-level health metrics
* Surfaces risks before dashboards fail

All without exposing database credentials to the SaaS layer.

---

# 🏗 HOW IT WORKS

## Step 1 – Deploy Archestra

Run Archestra locally or in Kubernetes.

## Step 2 – Deploy Bastion MCP

Deploy the Bastion MCP container inside your infrastructure.
It connects securely to your database.

## Step 3 – Connect Bastion SaaS

Register your Archestra endpoint in Bastion.
All orchestration happens through MCP — not direct DB access.

## Step 4 – Monitor, Compare, Enforce

Bastion stores schema versions, analyzes drift, and visualizes data health.

# 🧬 DIFFERENTIATION SECTION

## Heading:

> Not a Data Catalog. Not Just Observability.

| Traditional Tools      | Bastion                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Discovery-first        | Integrity-first            |
| Late anomaly detection | Preemptive drift detection |
| SaaS connects to DB    | DB stays inside your infra |
| AI suggestions         | Deterministic AI pipelines |
| Passive metadata       | Enforced control plane     |
